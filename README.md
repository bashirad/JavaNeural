# JavaNeural

Our code takes a set of Testing Data containing 28x28 px jpg files,
generates labels and encodes them based on file names, extracts the
pixels and adds them to byte arrays, converts labels to byte arrays and
encode them, then create MLData objects to run them through encog to
encode and normalize them.
To invoke the code, you must change the file paths in order to match
your own pcâ€™s paths and then run the zMTraining File.
